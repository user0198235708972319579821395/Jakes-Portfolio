## What is it?

Created "Sink It," a manually operated pinball-style basketball game constructed primarily from wood, designed as an engaging and tactile interactive experience.

## How Does it Work?

- Spring-loaded dowel launches a metal ball into the playfield.
- Basketball-themed ramp and hoop provide a 100-point target, with lower scoring zones worth 10 points and 0 points.
- Integrated return track ensures the ball consistently cycles back for the next round.
- Wooden frame assembled with screws and a nail gun, with 3D-printed lettering for visual detail.

## What is the Outcome?

"Sink It" successfully functioned as an engaging tabletop game, providing a tactile and skill-based interactive experience. The robust construction ensures its longevity, and the basketball theme, enhanced by the 3D-printed lettering, offers a visually appealing context.
