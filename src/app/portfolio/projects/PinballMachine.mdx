## What is it?

Creation of "Sink It," a manually operated pinball-style basketball game constructed primarily from wood, designed as an engaging and tactile interactive experience.

## How Does it Work?

- **Manual Plunger Mechanism**: Implemented a spring-loaded wooden plunger to manually launch a metal ball into the playfield, providing direct user control over the launch force and trajectory.
- **Themed Playfield**:  Developed a basketball-themed playfield featuring a miniature ramp leading to a hoop and backboard (scoring 100 points), along with additional lower scoring zones (10 points each, and a 0-point zone) to offer varied gameplay objectives.
- **Integrated Ball Return**: Designed the game to ensure the metal ball returns to a playable position after each launch, preventing disruption to the gameplay flow.
- **Robust Wooden Construction**: Utilized woodworking techniques including screwing and nail gun fastening to create a durable and stable structure intended to withstand repeated use.

## What is the Outcome?

"Sink It" successfully functions as an engaging tabletop game, providing a tactile and skill-based interactive experience. The robust construction ensures its longevity, and the basketball theme, enhanced by the 3D-printed lettering, offers a visually appealing and relatable context. This project demonstrates the successful application of woodworking, basic mechanical principles, and additive manufacturing to create a functional and enjoyable game, highlighting a commitment to quality and user-focused design.
