## What is it?
A pneumatic-mechanical locking mechanism designed to replace a customer’s unreliable motor-driven system on an automated assembly machine. The mechanism locks a sliding carriage in place during operation to improve reliability and reduce downtime.


## How Does it Work?
- Designed a compact C-frame assembly to house a pneumatic cylinder connected to a pivoting lock arm.
- Adapted the concept from a proven manually-operated locking mechanism on another machine in the factory, and automated it for this application.
- Incorporated linear guides and mounting plates in the CAD model to maintain alignment and structural integrity under load.
- Modeled and refined the design in SolidWorks to ensure proper clearances, mounting points, and integration into the existing machine.

## What is the Outcome?
The design was completed and presented to the customer for review. While it did not go into production during my time at the company, the concept offered a low-maintenance and reliable alternative to the existing system, with the potential to improve uptime and reduce service requirements.
