## What is it?
Designed a compact pneumatic-mechanical locking mechanism for an automated assembly machine, replacing a motor-driven system. The mechanism locks a sliding carriage during operation to improve reliability and reduce downtime.


## How Does it Work?
- Modeled the assembly in SolidWorks, ensuring proper clearances and alignment under load.
- Integrated a pneumatic cylinder with a pivoting lock arm, adapting a proven manual design for automation.
- Designed mounting plates and linear guides for precise alignment and structural integrity.
- Optimized components for easy assembly and minimal maintenance.

## What is the Outcome?
The design was completed and presented to the customer for review. While it did not go into production during my time at the company, the concept offered a low-maintenance and reliable alternative to the existing system, with the potential to improve uptime and reduce service requirements.
