## What is it?
A replacement crank handle for a garden hose reel, designed and 3D printed to replace a broken factory component.

## How Does it Work?

- Modeled in SolidWorks to replicate the original geometry and match the square drive shaft.
- Fastened with screws and reinforced using epoxy to strengthen known failure points from the original part.
- Printed in ABS, chosen for its strength and outdoor durability.
- Test print to ensure correct fit (3rd Picture)

## What is the Outcome?

The replacement handle restored full reel functionality and has held up to regular outdoor use with no signs of cracking or loosening.
