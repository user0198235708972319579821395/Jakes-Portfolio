## What is it?

Developed a semi-automated robotic system to sort golf balls by color and weight, using a combination of 3D-printed parts, Lego components, and an EV3 command brick for operation. The system aims to replace the manual sorting of golf balls, which is inefficient and costly for golf facilities. 

## How Does it Work?

- **Automated Sorting:** The system automatically sorts golf balls by weight using an elastic band bridge and by color using a robotic arm with a color sensor. 
- **Modular Design:** The software is designed with modular functions for easier debugging and testing. 
- **Material Flexibility:** The mechanical design uses a combination of 3D-printed parts for custom components like the hopper and claw, and Lego components for structural elements and motor integration
- **Error Handling:** The software includes an unjamming sequence to address ball jams in the wheel mechanism.

## What is the Outcome?

The RoboSort system successfully demonstrated the automated sorting of golf balls by weight and color.  The project provided a valuable hands-on experience for the team in designing, constructing, and programming a mechatronics system.
