## What is it?

Developed a semi-automated robotic system to sort golf balls by color and weight, using a combination of 3D-printed parts, Lego components, and an EV3 command brick for operation. The system aims to replace the manual sorting of golf balls, which is inefficient and costly for golf facilities. 

## How Does it Work?

- Utilizes an elastic band bridge to separate balls by weight and a robotic arm with a color sensor to distinguish colors.
- Built around modular software functions, simplifying debugging and subsystem testing.
- Combines custom 3D-printed parts (hopper, claw, rotating plate) with LEGO elements for structure and motor integration.
- Implements an unjamming routine in software to resolve golf ball jams during operation.

## What is the Outcome?

The RoboSort system successfully demonstrated the automated sorting of golf balls by weight and color.  The project provided a valuable hands-on experience for the team in designing, constructing, and programming a mechatronics system.
