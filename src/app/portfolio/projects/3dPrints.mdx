title: "3D Prints"
publishedAt: "2020-04-01"
summary: "This slideshow features 3D print models I've enjoyed printing & assembling.
I did not design any of these models and do not take credit for their creation. 
My goal with these prints was to learn."

## All of the things I learned for each of the models shown


## 2 Cylinder Engine with TT Motor:
- Explored gear ratios and how engine components interact  
- Used magnets for alignment and easy removal to showcase the gearbox
- Over 50 hours of printing and troubleshooting  
- Gained hands-on experience with mechanical timing and tolerancing

## 6 Cylinder Engine Powered by Drill:
- Observed multi-cylinder motion under load from a drill  
- Designed and replaced the support chain that broke shortly after assembling  
- Learned from DFM-related issues (e.g., M2 screws placed in hard-to-reach locations)

## Mini Tank:
- Bonded printed parts using friction welding  
- Practiced post-processing and joining methods

## Ford GT:
- Assembled with tight tolerances allowing press-fit wheels, no adhesives  
- Practiced part splitting and bonding for complex geometries

## F-16 Fighter Jet:
- Assembled with minimal adhesive due to accurate fits  
- Used a heat gun to temporarily deform parts for proper alignment
