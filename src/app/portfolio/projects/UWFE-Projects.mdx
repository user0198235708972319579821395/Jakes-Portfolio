## What is it: Dashboard

Designed the 2026 Formula Electric vehicle dashboard in SolidWorks, integrating electronic controls, driver displays, and structural mounts into a lightweight and manufacturable assembly. The dashboard houses over ten electrical components including emergency switches, status indicators, and the driver display unit.

## How does it Work? 
- Front panel constructed from Kevlar composite to reduce weight while eliminating electrical conductivity risks present in carbon fiber.
- Mounting bracket designed in AISI 4130 steel, featuring optimized internal cutouts to balance strength and mass.
- FEA simulation in SolidWorks used to identify stress concentrations and potential failure points under representative mounting and operational loads.
- Integrated button layout and display housing designed for intuitive driver access and improved visibility.

## What is the Outcome?

The redesign achieved a 65% weight reduction compared to the previous steel dashboard while improving manufacturability and electrical isolation. The Kevlar composite surface prevents short-circuit risks, while the refined steel mount maintains rigidity and structural reliability.

## What is it: Transponder Mount

Designed a 3D-printed ABS mount to secure the car’s transponder to the chassis tube while aligning flush against the vehicle’s interior for precise bolt-through installation.

## How does it Work? 
- Designed in SolidWorks to match the curvature of the chassis tube and interior panel for a secure, flush fit.
- Printed in ABS using FDM 3D printing, selected for its durability and temperature resistance.
- Mount geometry allows the transponder to be bolted through the body with precise alignment.
- Tested and iterated to refine tolerances and ensure reliable fit during assembly.

## What is the Outcome?

The mount was successfully implemented and improved both the reliability and ease of transponder installation, minimizing misalignment and saving build time.



## What is it: Firewall Stencil

Designed and 3D printed a two-piece stencil to mark precise hole locations on the firewall, ensuring accurate cuts for firewall pass-through and mounting.

## How does it Work? 

- Created in SolidWorks to match firewall contours and allow precise hole placement.
- Stencil was split into two interlocking parts to stay within print bed limits and simplify installation.
- Printed in PLA using FDM 3D printing, selected for its dimensional accuracy and ease of handling.

## Outcome

The stencil significantly reduced layout time and error margins, ensuring clean, properly positioned holes to prevent harness tearing.
