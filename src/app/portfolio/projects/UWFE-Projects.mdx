## What is it: Dashboard

Designed the 2026 Formula Electric vehicle dashboard in SolidWorks, integrating electronic controls, driver displays, and structural mounts into a lightweight and manufacturable assembly. The dashboard houses over ten electrical components including emergency switches, status indicators, and the driver display unit.

## How does it Work? 
- Front panel constructed from Kevlar composite for strength and weight reduction.
- Mounting bracket designed with an optimized lattice pattern, validated through FEA to minimize material use while maintaining structural rigidity.
- FEA simulation in SolidWorks confirmed extremely low stresses (&lt;0.002% of material yield), indicating high stiffness and safety margin.
- Integrated button layout and display housing designed for intuitive driver access and improved visibility.

## What is the Outcome?

The redesigned dash plate achieved a 65% weight reduction compared to the previous steel version while maintaining excellent rigidity and ergonomic alignment with the driver’s field of view. The final design integrates seamlessly with the steering and electronic systems, demonstrating a balance between aesthetic design, functionality, and structural efficiency.

## What is it: Transponder Mount

Designed a 3D-printed ABS mount to secure the car’s transponder to the chassis tube while aligning flush against the vehicle’s interior for precise bolt-through installation.

## How does it Work? 
- Designed in SolidWorks to match the curvature of the chassis tube and interior panel for a secure, flush fit.
- Printed in ABS using FDM 3D printing, selected for its durability and temperature resistance.
- Mount geometry allows the transponder to be bolted through the body with precise alignment.
- Tested and iterated to refine tolerances and ensure reliable fit during assembly.

## What is the Outcome?

The mount was successfully implemented and improved both the reliability and ease of transponder installation, minimizing misalignment and saving build time.



## What is it: Firewall Stencil

Designed and 3D printed a two-piece stencil to mark precise hole locations on the firewall, ensuring accurate cuts for firewall pass-through and mounting.

## How does it Work? 

- Created in SolidWorks to match firewall contours and allow precise hole placement.
- Stencil was split into two interlocking parts to stay within print bed limits and simplify installation.
- Printed in PLA using FDM 3D printing, selected for its dimensional accuracy and ease of handling.

## Outcome

The stencil significantly reduced layout time and error margins, ensuring clean, properly positioned holes to prevent harness tearing.
